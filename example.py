story = 'Each summer, more than 50,000 people pour into a cobblestone square in Tuscany for a gut-wrenching 90-seconds. That\'s all it takes for the flamboyantly dressed jockeys of Italy\'s legendary horse race -- Palio di Siena -- to race bareback around the medieval square. It\'s been called the "most dangerous horse race in the world" -- about as far away as you can get from the genteel green lawns of Britain\'s Royal Ascot or the multimillion prize money bestowed on America\'s Kentucky Derby. Now as the dust settles on this year\'s colorful Palio di Siena, CNN takes a look at five weird and wonderful horse festivals from across the world. Palio di Siena, Italy On two days each year, the pretty town of Siena in northern Tuscany is transformed into an elaborate medieval race track, with 10 riders careering around the iconic city square three times. Dating back to the 17th century, each rider represents their local neighborhood, competing not just for the coveted victory banner -- but good luck for the coming year. Luminarias Festival, Spain Fire and horses may seem like an unlikely combination, but that\'s exactly the dramatic scene which takes place in a small town in central Spain each year. Horse are ridden over blazing tree branches as part of the Luminaries Festival in San Bartolome de Pinares, in an effort to purify and protect the animals. The controversial tradition, which has been criticized by animal welfare groups, dates back 500 years and is held on the eve of Saint Anthony\'s Day. Watch: From camel racing to prized jockey White Turf, Switzerland From fiery Spain to snowy Switzerland -- there\'s not a bonfire in sight at the glitzy White Turf racing carnival, held on the frozen Lake St Moritz. The remarkable competition includes skijoring, where horses thunder around the icy track while their riders hold on for dear life to a harness at the back, trailing behind on skis. In such extreme weather -- around -20C -- fur coats are the order of the day for the champagne-sipping spectators who are perhaps better known for their luxury lifestyles than racing tips. Pasola Festival, Indonesia The glitz and glam of snow-capped St Moritz couldn\'t be further from the spear-wielding horsemen of Indonesia\'s annual Pasola Festival.'
